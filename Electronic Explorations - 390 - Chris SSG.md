# [[Electronic Explorations]] - 390 - [[Chris SSG]]

## Description

The aim for this mix was relatively straightforward: to present what I am doing with my ‘drone and bass’ DJ sets. In keeping with the forward thinking attitude of ‘Electronic Explorations’, I focused on presenting new music. 

Except for an old Conrad Schnitzler production I couldn’t resist including, basically everything else has been released in the last year. I also made an effort to include tracks from artists I think are exploring interesting territory. 

So if you like the mix, I strongly encourage you to look further into their discographies. 

The vast majority of the music here is easy to find in digital and other formats.

Thanks to Rob for the kind invitation to contribute to this excellent series, to Wata Igarashi for mastering the mix, and to Sae Murakami for the picture.

The mix was recorded in one take on a Sunday afternoon in September 2015. It is entitled ‘[[music for nominal spaces]]’.
