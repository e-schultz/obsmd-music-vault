# X as Artist Discovery

In recent years, I've become a bit more passive in my music discovery.  I don't actively crawl through track lists as often as I used to, or seek out related artists all the time.

I still do, just not as often.

Instead of relying purely on the algoritms of apple or soundcloud, is I will look at things like event planners, party promoters, podcasts, etc as a music discovery service.

While I do enjoy the related suggestions to the podcast series, it is nice to have an aspect of curation happening there.
