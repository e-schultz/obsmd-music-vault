It was the [[MNML SSGS]] Blog that introduced me to artists like [[Donato Dozzy]] and [[natural-electronic.system|natural/electronic.system]] ^62ab26

It was the early 2000's, and my musical taste was starting to shift from Psytrance "harder, faster, better" type of music - to more interest in techno, house and minimal.

Minimal techno was blowing up in the early 2000s, with labels like [[Minus Records]], artists like [[Richie Hawtin]], etc really making minimal into the "mainstream of the underground" for awhile.

I used to be really active on a forum called [[mnml.nl]] [mnml.nl](https://www.mnml.nl/phpBB3/) - that had a really active forum for sharing DJ sets and podcasts.

It's where I found a lot of my early music, before the days of soundcloud - and when I was more active in seeking out stuff, before I started to think of podcasts as [[202011272118 X as Artist Discovery|think of podcasts as a source of artist discovery]]

While artists like Hawtin I found played very "club techno", which I really enjoy - it's Donato Dozzy that really opened me upto the world of the more psychedelic, atsmopheric moody techno - the kind of music that creates a soundscape for my head to rest on.
