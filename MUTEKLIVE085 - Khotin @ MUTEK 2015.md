EXPÃ‰RIENCE 2 :: GLITTERING NEU-STALGIA
Friday, May 29 - Parterre du Quartier des spectacles

By stacking up the gratifyingly loose grooves of classic hardware (such as the Roland TR-505, 707 and SH-101) using his strong command of the genre, Edmonton producer Khotin (Dylan Khotin-Foote) makes light, textural daydream house. 

Since taking on the roles of resident DJ and part manager of label/party series [[Normals Welcome]], Khotin has sharpened his gauzy synth sensibility and refined his unique slant on effervescent acid and mellow, yet passionately messy house. 

His brightly hued melodic landings have led to a stream of talked about releases on imprints such as [[1080p]], [[Normals Welcome]], [[Fauxpas Musik]], [[Heart To Heart]], and 
[[Common Edit]], all within a year. 

Khotin debuted his heavily improvised live performance at MUTEK, bringing a distant take on cosmic hardware vibes.
