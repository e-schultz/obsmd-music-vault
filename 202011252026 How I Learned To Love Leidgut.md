I remember when I first heard [[AtomTM]]s new album [[AtomTM - Liedgut]] - at initial listen, it left me wondering "what the hell is this?" - at initial glance, it's an album that doesn't make much sense.

Initially, I did a quick skim through the album - jumping ahead every few seconds to see what it would be like. I had heard of [[AtomTM]] before - but wasn't sure what to expect on this album.

Each song is so different - one moment there is blips and clicks, later on a drone, in other parts it sounds like the interference from a cellphone tower, or a nostalgic sound of broken toys. 

But just skimming it, doesn't give you a full sense of the album - it wasn't until I really sat down and gave it a dedicated listen, that the beauty of it started to shine through.

From the sound design, #tk how things .... #tk
