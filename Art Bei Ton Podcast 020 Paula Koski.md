## Description

Art Bei Ton Podcast 020: [[Paula Koski]]
( @paulakoski )

Today is the 20th episode of our new podcast series and we are extremely happy to welcome for the talented Paula Koski.

Paula was our first podcast releases nearly a year ago and, after having a beautiful Ambient set from her, we also decided to release this dope Hypnotic Techno set - recorded at our Bday streaming event (Art Bei Ton: LIVE 1 on 16.05.20 from Fiese Remise).

Enjoy this spacy journey to another planet, flying over new landscapes and discovering the beauty of the unknown!

More info about Paula Koski:

Paula Koski has carved out a niche for herself with a multifaceted sound that ranges from ambient to experimental to richly layered, dark and hypnotic contemporary techno.

Textured sounds and profound basslines are in focus on the unique selections that Paula plays increasingly around Europe, sharing stages with her favorite artists.

Finland-born Paula is one of the curators of techno platform [[Monument]], and this position provides her a kaleidoscopic perspective on techno's hypnotic side.
