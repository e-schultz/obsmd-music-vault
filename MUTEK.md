MUTEK is a Music Festival that initially started in Montreal, but has expanded over the years to include locations like Mexico and Barcelona 

The first year I went to Mutek was [[Mutek 2006]],  and one of the events that I remember the most is [[Richie Hawtin vs Ricardo Villalobos live at PicNic]]
