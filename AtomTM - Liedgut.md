# [[AtomTM]] - Leidgut

[[Raster Norton]]
from a contemporary point of view, atom™'s »liedgut« may be considered a romantic work. while researching his own past, atom™ found himself in the austro-german time, space, thinking and feeling. between nietzsche, helmholtz, schubert and many other guidelines, atom™ absorbed a universe striving for clarity and simplicity, where science and irrationality, ornament and mathematic purity were the key elements of a (still) oscillating social and mental order. »liedgut« therefore oscillates between those poles: scientific exercises on schubertian chord progressions, digital waltzes and romantic lyrics.

this research consistently lead him to the post-romantic works of [[oskar sala]], [[kraftwerk]] and others, who could be seen as direct heirs of the romantic movement. upon completition of the album, florian schneider, former member of kraftwerk, contributed a spoken epilogue, commenting the leitmotiv of »liedgut« in the track »weißes rauschen« (white noise). for atom™, the phenomenon of white noise perfectly served as an analogue expression of the romantic dualism: scientificly defined on the one hand, it is described in a poetic manner, seeking for a more profound meaning on the other. »wellen und felder« (waves and fields), which directly connects to »weißes rauschen«, similarly refers to both scientific models and philosophic/poetic ideas.

consequently, atom™'s research does not stop here thus managing to convey »liedgut« into the present. both form and content appear to be explicitly new and contemporary, yet ex-temporary at the same time.
