## Description

Leaves lose their effervescence, stroking the strings of the ground as they bring us into the colder months. Such is the sound that resonates out of Chris SSG, our next guest from Japan. 

A master of mesmerizing, emotive passages, he is known for his careful consideration, patient execution, and sublime selections. 

As co-founder of the now-defunct [[MNML SSGS]] blog and event series and a resident at the semi-regular Sound Garden chill out parties, he has spread his infectious love for boundless forms of music far and wide, reaching audiences across the globe. 

After hearing his acclaimed mixes for podcasts such as Electronic Exploration and Mysteries of the Deep, we are ecstatic to have him contribute to UNRUSH. 

So grab a blanket, some tea, and watch the eternal processes of decay and rebirth unfold before you with this very special session from Chris SSG.
