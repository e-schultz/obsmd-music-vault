## Description

LUMISOKEA (BE/IT)
NOCTURNE 2 :: GLEAMINGS AND BEAMINGS
Thursday, May 28 - Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal

As Lumisokea, Belgium’s [[Koenraad Ecker]] and [[Andrea Taeggi ]]originally from Italy, ground their rich, tactile music in physical space and then transcend it, building texture upon texture through analog hardware and acoustic instrumentation. 

Based in Berlin, the duo draws on world wide influences to create a dark techno rife with dub and noise, Asian and African traditional percussion and contemporary classical experimentation. 

They’ve released two albums on Dutch label [[Eat Concrete]], a 25 minute musique concrète suite and an EP of cyclical rhythms and reel-to-reel tape treatments on [[Opal Tapes]]. 

Integral to Lumisokea’s introspective live experience is designer [[Yannick Jacquet]] ([[Legoman]]), a founding member of European visual label AntiVJ, who challenges the bounds of human perception by seamlessly weaving projected light artistry into the musicians’ live set, beaming abstract geometrical visuals into a smokey pitch black room. 

After expansive sets at the [[Bozar Electronic Arts Festival]] in Belgium and the T[[ransient Festival]] in Paris, Lumisokea made their North American premiere at [[MUTEK]].

Lumisokea are represented by Berlin Current, a CTM Festival-led initiative funded by Musicboard Berlin that aims to identify and support emerging sounds from the city.
